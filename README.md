= Range Networks SDR1 Open Source Software-Defined Radio =

The Range Networks SDR1 consists of two individual PCBs that work in tandem, referred to as the SDR module and the RF module (or board). The SDR module provides signal processing and digital data transfer between the RF signals and the host. The RF module provides the wireless transmission of the data. The SDR and RF module boards are each on a 5.5" x 3.25" PCB outline. This is a stacked design with a single interface connector between them. The RF module uses the same PCB layout with different component stuffing options and is capable of supporting the following frequency bands: 850, 900, 1800, 1900 MHz. The SDR1 is based in large part on the USRP1 design.
